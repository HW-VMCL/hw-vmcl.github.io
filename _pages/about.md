Hi! My name is Hongyuan Wang (王鸿远). I'm a second year M.S. student from School of Computer Scinence, Beijing Institute of Technology, supervised by [Prof. Lizhi Wang](https://wang-lizhi.github.io/). I received my bachelor's degree form the same school. I'm interested in computer photography, low-level vision, generative model, and deep learning. 

I enjoy researching the working principles of neural networks and designing neural networks that are in harmony with the characteristics of data. I am always fascinated by the exploration of the unknown.

[Learning Exhaustive Correlation for Spectral Super-Resolution: Where Spatial-Spectral Attention Meets Linear Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12833)

**Hongyuan Wang**, Lizhi Wang, Jiang Xu, Chang Chen, Xue Hu, Fenglong Song, Youliang Yan

**Project** (Coming soon)

- Our method can model unified spatial-spectral correlation, local and non-local correlation, and low-rank and full-rank correlation, thus modeling exhaustive correlation within hyperspectral images.
